// Instructions for Finalizing DLL Structure and Compilation

1. Finalize DLL Structure:
   - Ensure all source files (DirectX12Base.cpp, RDNAOptimizations.cpp, RayTracingEnhancements.cpp, MainIntegration.cpp) are correctly referenced in your project.
   - Confirm that all dependencies, especially those related to DirectX 12, are correctly configured in your project settings.

2. Compilation Instructions:
   - Open your C++ development environment (such as Visual Studio).
   - Create a new project and set the project type to 'Dynamic-Link Library (DLL)'.
   - Add all the source files to your project.
   - In project properties, set the configuration type to 'Dynamic Library (.dll)'.
   - Configure the include directories to include the DirectX 12 SDK headers.
   - Ensure the linker is set up to link against the necessary DirectX 12 libraries.
   - Compile the project. This should generate a '.dll' file.

3. Testing and Deployment Guidance:
   - Test the compiled DLL in a controlled development environment first.
   - Integrate the DLL into a test game that uses DirectX 12 and supports ray tracing.
   - Observe the performance changes, particularly in scenes with intensive ray tracing.
   - If the DLL works as expected, it can be deployed for broader use.
   - To deploy, simply place the DLL in the same directory as the game's executable or in a directory that is in the game's search path for libraries.
